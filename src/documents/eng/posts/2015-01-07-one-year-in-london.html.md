Exactly one year ago I moved from a hospitable, quiet and snowy Finland to the island of Great Britain. It was sort of a bold move, a leap into something very unknown. This post is a brief list of reflections, which might (or might not) help someone else to get an idea what it's like to live in London.

####General feelings

It shouldn't come as a surprize that being a tourist somewhere, and living in exact same place are two very different things. When traveling to London and enjoying its attractions, often you would do it during week in daytime. This is something you will not be able to do once you actually move here. Unless you opt for spending your holidays in London (which is not such a bad idea), daily routine and office hours will push everything else to the weekend. Now, on weekend in addition to all the tourists now we also have local crowds desperately trying to get around and entertain themselves.

Coming from a place like Finland, amount of people around can be mind boggling. They are everywhere. You start appreciating places with slightly less amount of people. Thing is, everybody else are hunting for such places too.

####Cost of living

Food and cafes are slightly cheaper than in Finland. Renting apartment is about twice the amount you'd pay in Helsinki. Generally speaking, half of the income goes towards rent and utility bills. There is also council tax, which will cost anything between Â£70-200 depending on the size and cost of the place (better place - higher tax).

Most of houses are not energy efficient - again something you get for granted in Finland. That usually means bad windows with single layer of glass and non-existent insulation. There is generally no such thing as central heating, and every house / apartment is on its own. That also means that when you start burning natural gas or electricity in order to warm yourself up, most of that heat will go as contribution to the global warming, and not warming of your house - unless you are lucky to live in the energy efficient house with double-blazed windows and good insulation.

####People

Pretty much everyone is open and easy to communicate with. In fact, coming from Finland this might be almost shocking. People will talk to you more than usual, will make contact and ask questions about yourself. There is obviously a catch - most of such conversations are small talk, which is important part of being socially accepted and considered a nice person. You might end up doing lots of small talk but not finding anyone, who would actually genuinely be interested in spending time with you.

Over the last year me and my wife met some of the most wonderful people. I think, if you want to find interesting people and great friends, London is the place to be. In a way, being cramped into a relatively small place, riddled with challenges to survive, you have to help each other. London is also a huge crossroad where you can find all sorts of people. All the most talented people of the world are here all around. And that might be the biggest reason to move here.
