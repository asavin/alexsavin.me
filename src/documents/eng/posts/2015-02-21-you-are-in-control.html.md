I wanted to write this post for some time now. It appears that most users of Internet perceive browser pretty much the same way as TV set.

Here is how you'd use TV in most cases:

* Pick a channel
* Watch it as long as it keeps you entertained
* If too late, switch TV off. If not, go to line 1.

Internet has a lot in common with TV. With one tiny little detail that is often forgotten (or not very much advertised).

You are in full control.

I'm going to repeat this. You're in full control of your machine, your browser, and whatever content you are retrieving from Internet. You are free to filter content in any way you like. You can consume content partially or choose not to request it at all. You can choose your appearance or choose to protect your privacy. You can even pretend you're in another country.

It's all up to you.

We are living in a world where services like Facebook own your name and look, and by default allows any 3rd party to re-use picture and name of yourself in any commercial activities. To put it straight - you do not have exclusive rights to use your name or your look anymore. Everybody just trying to make profit any way possible, and sometimes they would tell you that filtering out online ads or alter content of the website is illegal.

It's actually not. There are certain business interests to make money. In most cases, they have very little to do with law. It's just one party plans to make profit by executing a strategy. In most cases no law stops you as a user to execute something calles `business strategy subversion`. Sometimes companies like [FACT](http://www.fact-uk.org.uk/) would tell you that you might face jail for filming copyrighted content while in cinema. This plan however crumbles when an actual judge [rules out](http://torrentfreak.com/student-not-guilty-in-first-3d-movie-piracy-case-150114/) that filming while at cinema has very little to do with criminal offence.

Again, you're planning to make a buck, and then world happens. People behave in unpredictable ways, most often trying to give you as little of their moneys as possible. The controversial thing to say would be that this is the natural way of things. Today most of things are run in the same way as commercial companies - including things like countries. You have to be profitable, or else. But commercial profitability cannot be put at the foundation of everything. Lots of amazing things like science and art generally do not generate any sort of profit. You throw budgets at it, and in return get nothing. Should we stop then people from doing these useless things like painting and going to space? Well, if you're judging by profitability of it, yes. But there is another way of judging things.

Awesomeness.

If something is awesome, you're ready to do it for free. Not only do it, but also share results. For free. With everyone. So they could appreciate the awesomeness, and do more of it.

It's like a decease spreading around. People will find time and ways of contributing. Things like open sourced software wouldn't happen, if we'd only do things in return for material compensation. Things like Internet would never happen if it wouldn't be for this feeling of something huge, awesome, completely open, and obviously free at its heart.

There were quite a few attempts to make [special](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AOL), paid kind of Internet. They all failed, and that was the moment when companies realised that you should not mess with the fundamental rule of the Internet: access should be free. If you give users free access and great tools to generate content, you can then re-sell this content, or meta-information about users and content. So, things looks like they are free and open, but in fact you are the product.

This is where you come in. Yes, you can simply delete your online accounts and try and stop to be a product. Or you can use a few tricks.
