By now, automated testing of code has hopefully become an industry standard. Ideally, you write your tests first and make them a runnable specification of what your code should do. When done right, test-driven development can improve code design, not mentioning you have a regression test suite to stop you from accidentally breaking things in the future.

However, unit testing does just what it says on the tin: tests the code units (modules, classes, functions) in isolation. To know the whole application or system works, you need to test the integration of those modules.

That’s nothing new either. At least in the web application world, which this post is about, we’ve had tools like Cucumber (which lets you write user scenarios in an almost human language) for years. You can then run these tests on a continuous integration server (we use the amazing CircleCI) and get a green light for every commit you push.

But when it comes to testing how things work in different web browsers, the situation is not that ideal. Or rather it wasn’t.
