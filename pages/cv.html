          Currently looking for a new and exciting opportunity to help with
          developing your tech stack.

        <h2 id="bulb---london---june-2017---present">
          Bulb - London - June 2017 - present
        </h2>
        <p>
          One of the first engineers to be hired into the company. Bulb is an
          energy provider trying to differentiate from the rest of the
          competition by investing in its digital products. To help realise this
          mission from the beginning I was involved in all key products,
          external and internal.
        </p>
        <p>
          Worked with both frontend and backend using Node.js / Typescript
          combo. Heavily used Kubernetes hosted on Google Cloud where we hosted
          most of our products and cronjobs. Invested in microservice
          architecture and implemented GraphQL interfaces for our frontend apps.
        </p>
        <h3 id="leadership">Leadership</h3>
        <p>
          In addition to a senior dev role, I also tech-led teams of various
          sizes, from 2 to 10 developers. This involved me helping across teams
          with technical blockers, working with product managers, data science
          and design to shape products and delivery, writing performance reviews
          and organising 1-1 catch-ups. I was also in charge of running all
          agile rituals - daily standups, sprint refinements, retrospectives and
          sprint plannings.
        </p>
        <h3 id="most-recent-project">Most recent project</h3>
        <p>
          I've been in charge of technical delivery on Revenue Assurance and
          Debt Recovery project for the past ~1.5 years. This involved shipping
          multiple automated backend solutions for detecting cashflow related
          issues and applying a series of actions to recover lost revenue.
        </p>
        <p>
          On a practical side, this meant designing and deploying several cloud
          services and cronjobs, running daily, processing huge amounts of data
          and dispatching emails, SMS:s, pre-recorded voice calls and actual
          printed letters (which we rendered using React).
        </p>
        <p>
          This project involved dealing with the highly sensitive subject of
          financials, so I had to develop and apply a set of good practices
          around code quality and QA.
        </p>
        <h3 id="shadow-testing">Shadow testing</h3>
        <p>
          Pioneered shadow testing techniques for safe production releases in
          Revenue Assurance project. You can read everything about it in my
          blog:

        <h3 id="hiring">Hiring</h3>
        <p>
          Performed hundreds of on-site tech interviews and actively helped in
          hiring great talent.

        <h3 id="tesco">Tesco</h3>
        <p>
          One of the senior devs on the project to deliver brand new online
          grocery experience across 7 countries on both mobile and desktop. If
          you ever find yourself on a Polish mobile website, that was me (at
          some point):

        </p>
        <p>
          I and my team brought React and Node.js, implemented a universal React
          app that worked with and without JavaScript support (good for feature
          phones), enabling a continuous integration pipeline and eventually
          ability to deploy to live multiple times on the same day.

        <p><a href="https://asos.com">https://asos.com</a></p>
        <p>
          Did a bit of frontend development for the brand new ASOS online
          shopping experience. React, Node, ES6 and FlowType. Lots of unit
          tests.

            >https://meetup.react.london/</a
          >
          and presented on several occasions at the beginning of the meetup when
          it was still a small gathering of friends in the basement of our Old
          Street office.
        </p>
        <p>Later helped to organise React London conference in 2017.</p>

        <p>
          Got my bachelor's degree in computer engineering at Oulu University,
          Finland - in 2003. Studies were in Finnish language, however, my
          diploma was in English - and it was around visualising automated
          processes on an oil processing plant Fortum where I did my summer
          training.
